PATS: Pedagogically Adaptive Tutoring System

ðŸ§  Introduction
The Pedagogically Adaptive Tutoring System (PATS) is designed to generate adaptive tutoring responses by integrating student traitsâ€”such as personality dimensions and mastery levelsâ€”into the response generation process. This system leverages state-of-the-art language models to deliver personalized feedback and support during tutoring sessions.

The system evaluates its performance using established linguistic metrics, including BLEU, BERTScore, and DialogRPT, across datasets like CIMA and TSCC.
