**PATS: Pedagogically Adaptive Tutoring System**

## 🧠 Overview

The Pedagogically Adaptive Tutoring System (PATS) is a research prototype for generating pedagogically adaptive tutoring responses using large language models.
Rather than producing generic explanations, PATS explicitly models individual learner characteristics—such as personality traits and mastery levels—and incorporates them into the response generation process.

The system first infers a student’s learning profile from dialogue history and then selects an appropriate teaching strategy using a rule-based pedagogical engine.
This strategy is injected into the language model via prompting, enabling the tutor to respond in a way that better reflects human instructional behavior.

## 🔧 Code Status

The repository currently contains documentation and example configurations.
The main experimental code and model pipelines are being cleaned and organized for public release and will be added in a future update.
